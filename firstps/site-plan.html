      <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
      <p>
        The Star Wars Mini-A-Thon is a family friendly event. People can and will most likely have different ideas and beliefs at this event. This is an event to get away from the real world and enjoy Star Wars, not to argue and fight, except in the tournament with lightsabers. People may made and wear costumes that are personal ideas and add ons, or even ones that are just related to Star Wars (Space Balls: If George Lucas himself was able to allow and support this movie, you can as well). But due to this as a family friendly event, we must ask, as our rules, that everyone refrain from innapropriate costumes and language. Those who don't follow, will be asked to leave.
